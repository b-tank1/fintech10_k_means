This is the week 10 homework submission for the fintech bootcamp. In this exercise, I use various time-series models such as linear regression, ARMA, ARIMA and GARCH to predict movement in the CAD-JPY exchange rates.<br>

The conclusion of the analysis is that June 2020 (last period of the test data), was not a good time to buy Japanese Yen as the price was projected to decrease with increasing volatility.
